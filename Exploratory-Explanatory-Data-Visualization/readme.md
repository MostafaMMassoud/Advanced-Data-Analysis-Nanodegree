# PISA2012 DataSet

## About Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. 
It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, 
it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

>Around 500,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, 
mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 
44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.
